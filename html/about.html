            <h2>ABOUT THE OWNER</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I competed 
                as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my knowledge and 
                expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump into the ring as 
                your sparring partner.
            </p>

            <p>
                For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene. 
                He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his 
                knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with 
                passion and enthusiasm.
            </p>

            <p>The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly energised.</p>

            <p>
                Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer, you will 
                gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best cardiovascular workouts available.
